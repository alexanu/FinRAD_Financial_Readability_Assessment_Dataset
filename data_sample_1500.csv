Modelling,"When economists make a number of simplified assumptions about how the economy, or some part of it, behaves, and then see what this implies in various different scenarios. MILTON FRIEDMAN argued that economic models should not be judged on the basis of the validity of their assumptions, but on the accuracy of their predictions. An expert billiards player, he said, may not know the laws of physics, but acts as if he knows such laws. So his behaviour could be predicted accurately with a model that assumes he knows the laws of physics. Likewise, the behaviour of people making economic decisions may be accurately predicted by a model that assumes their goal is, say, PROFIT MAXIMISATION, even if they are not actually conscious of this being their goal. The more complex the thing being modelled, the harder it is to get right. Economic FORECASTING has a poor overall track record. The more micro­economic the thing being modelled, the more likely it is that a model can be designed that will deliver accurate predictions.",economist,1,58.01,10.5,13.8,10.62,12.6,8.63,39,13.4,13.03,10th and 11th grade,94.8,88.7,40.98,3.2,53.566473988439306,54.86

The UK (with others) returned to the gold standard in 1925, before quitting it for good in 1931. The widespread use of the gold standard ended during 1930-33 as a result of global depression and large cuts in international lending. The United States left the gold standard in 1933 and partially returned to it in 1934.

Short-termism,"Doing things that make you better off in the short-run but worse off in the end. After the bursting of the stockmarket bubble and the failure of Enron at the start of the 2000s, much like during the 1980s, accusations of short-termism were often made against the stockmarket-focused CAPITALISM of the United States and the UK. During the bubble, it was claimed, investors had become too focused on short-term profits and changes in share prices, and failed to probe deeply enough into long-term performance. As a result, managers did things that made their profits look as good as possible in the short run, often to the detriment of their company's long-term health. Indeed, many firms engaged in misleading and even fraudulent accounting practices to inflate short-term profits. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the complaint took a slightly different form, and was arguably less convincing, namely that short-termism caused lower levels of INVESTMENT by businesses than in countries where the stockmarket was less important, such as Germany and Japan.",economist,1,51.31,13.1,13.0,12.42,17.2,9.43,33,14.25,13.88,12th and 13th grade,88.1,87.25,36.21,3.1,47.40236686390532,39.71

"Marx, Karl","Much followed, and much misunderstood, German economist (1818–83). His two best-known works were the Communist Manifesto, written in 1848 with Friedrich Engels, and Das Kapital, in four volumes published between 1867 and 1910. Most of his economic assumptions were drawn from orthodox CLASSICAL ECONOMICS, but he used them to reach highly unorthodox conclusions. Although claimed and blamed as the inspiration of some of the most virulently anti-market governments the world has ever seen, he was not wholly against CAPITALISM. Indeed, he praised it for rescuing millions of people from “the idiocy of rural life”. Even so, he thought it was doomed. A shortage of DEMAND would concentrate economic power and wealth in ever fewer hands, producing an ever-larger and more miserable proletariat. This would eventually rise up, creating a “dictatorship of the proletariat” and leading eventually to a “withering away” of the state. Marx thought that this version of history was inevitable. So far, history has proved him wrong, largely because capitalism has delivered a much better deal to the masses than he believed it would.",economist,1,53.61,10.2,13.8,12.76,12.8,10.25,48,11.5,13.18,12th and 13th grade,92.9,87.64,38.28,3.4,52.125,46.36

Wealth effect,"As people get wealthier, they consume more. This wealth effect has important consequences for MONETARY POLICY. When there is an INTEREST RATE increase, future INCOME from ASSETS such as EQUITIES must be discounted at a higher rate than before. As a result their owners feel poorer and spend less. A cut in interest rates has the opposite effect. Economists disagree on the wealth ELASTICITY of CONSUMPTION: how much consumer spending would rise if wealth increased by, say, 1%. Different consumers may have different wealth elasticity. If most of the increase in wealth goes to poorer people this may have a different wealth effect than if most of it went to people who are already wealthy. The source of the wealth increase may also matter. If SHARE         PRICES rise or interest rates fall, consumers may be slow to spend out of their increased wealth if they think the increase may be temporary. However, if they think a sharp rise in share prices is permanent and the stockmarket then tumbles, the result may be that consumption falls by enough to cause a RECESSION.

Over its lifetime, one generation's mix of taxes paid and benefits received may differ sharply from that of another generation. Politicians are often tempted to ignore the needs of future generations (who, clearly, cannot vote at the time) in order to win the support of current generations, for instance by borrowing heavily to fund current spending.

In theory, however, transfer prices are supposed to be set according to the arm's-length principle: that they should be the same as would be charged if the sale was to a business unconnected in any way to the selling firm.
