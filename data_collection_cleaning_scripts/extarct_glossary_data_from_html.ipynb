The ability of Coun-try A to produce a commodity  ciently @i.e., with greater output per unit of input@ than Country B. Possession of such an absolute advantage does not nec-essarily mean that A can export this commodity to B successfully. Country B may still have the com-parative advantage.     $$&$$Actual, cyclical, and structural bud-get.    The  actual budget  cit or surplus is the amount recorded in a given year. This is composed of the  structural budget,  which calcu-lates what government revenues,  cits would be if the economy were operating at potential output, and the  cycli-cal budget,  which measures the effect of the business cycle on the budget.     $$&$$Adaptive expectations.    See  expecta-tions.      $$&$$Adverse selection.    A type of market failure in which those people with the highest risk are the most likely to buy insurance. More broadly, adverse selection encompasses sit-uations in which sellers and buyers have different information about a product, such as in the market for used cars.     $$&$$Aggregate demand.    Total planned or desired spending in the economy during a given period.

The curve showing the relationship between the quantity of goods and services that people are willing to buy and the aggregate price level, other things equal. As with any demand curve, important variables lie behind the aggregate demand curve, e.g., government spending, exports, and the money supply.     Aggregate supply.    The total value of goods and ser rms would willingly produce in a given time period. Aggregate supply is a function of available inputs, tech-nology, and the price level.     Aggregate supply @  AS   @ curve.    The curve showing the relationship  rms would willingly supply and the aggregate price level, other things equal.

The rise in value of a capital asset, such as land or com-mon stocks, the gain being the difference between the sales price and the purchase price of the asset.     $$&$$Capital markets  @also  financial mar-kets @.    nancial resources @money, bonds, stocks@ are traded. These, along with   nan-cial intermediaries,  are institutions through which saving in the econ-omy is transferred to investors.     Capital-output ratio.    In economic-growth theory, the ratio of the total capital stock to annual GDP.     $$&$$Capital widening.

A change in the quantity buyers want to purchase, prompted by any reason other than a change in price @e.g., increase in income, change in tastes@, is a  change in demand.  In graphical terms, it is a shift of the demand curve. If, in contrast, the decision to buy more or less is prompted by a change in the good’s price, then it is a  change in quantity demanded.  In graphical terms, a change in quantity demanded is a movement along an unchanging demand curve.     $$&$$Change in supply vs. change in quan-tity supplied.    This distinction for supply is the same as that for demand, so see  change in demand vs. change in quantity demanded.      Checking accounts @ also  checkable deposits  and  bank money@.    A deposit in a commercial bank or  nancial intermediary upon which checks can be written and which is therefore transactions money @or  M  1 @. Checkable depos-its are about half of  M  1 .

Sometimes called a  centrally planned economy.      Commodity money.    $$&$$Money.with  intrinsic value;  also, the use of some commodity @cattle, beads, etc.@ as money.     $$&$$Common currency.    A situation where several countries form a mone-tary union with a single currency  ed central bank; e.g., the European Monetary Union @EMU@, which introduced the Euro in 1999.     $$&$$Common stock.     nancial instru-ment representing ownership and, generally, voting rights in a corpo-ration. A certain share of a com-pany’s stock gives the owner title to that fraction of the votes, net earn-ings, and assets of the corporation.     $$&$$Communism.    A communist eco-nomic system @also called  Soviet-style central planning @ is one in which the state owns and controls the means of production, par-ticularly industrial capital. Such economies are also characterized by extensive central planning, with the state setting many prices, output levels, and other important economic variables.     Comparative advantage    @in interna-tional trade@    .   The law of compar-ative advantage says that a nation should specialize in producing and exporting those commodi-ties which it can produce at  rela-tively  lower cost and that it should import those goods for which it is a  relatively  high-cost producer. Thus it is a comparative advantage, not an absolute advantage, that should dictate trade patterns.     Compensating differentials.    Differ-ences in wage rates among jobs that serve to offset or compensate for the nonmonetary differences of the jobs. For example, unpleas-ant jobs that require isolation for many months in Alaska pay wages much higher than those for simi-lar jobs nearer to civilization.     Competition, imperfect.    Term ap-plied to markets in which per-fect competition does not hold because at least one seller @or buyer@ is large enough to affect the market price and therefore faces a downward-sloping demand @or supply@ curve. $$&$$Imperfect competition.refers to any kind of market imperfection—pure  monopoly, oligopoly,  or  monopo-listic competition.      $$&$$Competition, perfect.    Term applied  rm or con-sumer is large enough to affect the market price. This situation arises where @1@ the number of sellers and buyers is very large and @2@ the products offered by sellers are homogeneous @or indistinguish-able@. Under such conditions,  rm faces a horizontal @or perfectly elastic@ demand curve.     Competitive equilibrium.    The bal-ancing of supply and demand in a market or economy characterized by  perfect competition.  Because perfectly competitive sellers and buyers individually have no power  uence the market, price will move to the point at which it equals both marginal cost and marginal utility.     Competitive market.    See  competi-tion, perfect.      $$&$$Complements.    Two goods which “go together” in the eyes of consumers @e.g., left shoes and right shoes@. Goods are  substitutes  when they compete with each other @as do gloves and mittens@.     Compound interest.    $$&$$Interest.com-puted on the accrued total of inter-est and principal. For example, suppose $100 @the principal@ is deposited in an account earning 10 percent interest compounded annually. At the end of year 1, interest of $10 is earned. At the end of year 2, the interest payment is $11, $10 on the original princi-pal and $1 on the interest—and so on in future years.     Concentration ratio.    The percent-age of an industry’s total output  rms. A typical measure is the   rm concentration ratio,  which is the fraction of output accounted for  rms.     $$&$$Constant returns to scale.    See  returns to scale.      $$&$$Consumer price index @CPI@.    A price index that measures the cost of a  xed basket of consumer goods in which the weight assigned to each commodity is the share of expen-ditures on that commodity in a base year.     Consumer surplus.    The difference between the amount that a con-sumer would be willing to pay for a commodity and the amount actu-ally paid. This difference arises because the marginal utilities @in dollar terms@ of all but the last unit exceed the price. Under certain conditions, the money value of consumer surplus can be measured @using a demand curve diagram@ as the area under the demand curve but above the price line.     $$&$$Consumption.    In macroeconomics, the total spending, by individuals or a nation, on consumer goods during a given period. Strictly speaking, consumption should apply only to those goods totally used, enjoyed, or “eaten up” within that period. In practice, consump-tion expenditures include all consumer goods bought, many of which last well beyond the period in question—e.g., furniture, cloth-ing, and automobiles.     $$&$$Consumption.function.

T xed cost is made up of such individual contractual costs as interest payments, mortgage pay-ments, and directors’ fees.     $$&$$Cost, marginal.    The extra cost @or the increase in total cost@ required to produce 1 extra unit of output @or the reduction in total cost from producing 1 unit less@.     $$&$$Cost, minimum.    The lowest attain-able cost per unit @whether aver-age, variable, or marginal@. Every point on an average cost curve is a minimum in the sense that it is the  rm can do with respect to cost for the output which that point represents. Minimum aver-age cost is the lowest point, or points, on that curve.     $$&$$Cost, total.    The minimum attainable total cost, given a particular level of technology and set of input prices.  Short-run total cost  takes  xed costs as given.  Long-run total cost  is the cost that would be incurred if the   exibility with respect to all inputs and decisions.     $$&$$Cost, variable.

See  supply-shock  ation.      $$&$$Credit.    @1@ In monetary theory, the use of someone else’s funds in exchange for a promise to pay @usually with interest@ at a later date. The major examples are short-term loans from a bank, credit extended by suppliers, and commercial paper. @2@ In balance-of-payments accounting, an item such as exports that earns a coun-try foreign currency.     $$&$$Cross elasticity of demand.    A mea- uence of a change in one good’s price on the demand for another good. More precisely, the cross elasticity of demand equals the percentage change in demand for good A when the price of good B changes by 1 per-cent, assuming other variables are held constant.     $$&$$Currency.    Coins and paper money.     $$&$$Currency.appreciation @ or  depre-ciation@.    See  depreciation  @of a currency@.     $$&$$$$&$$Currency.board.

See  balance of trade.      $$&$$Cyclical budget.    See  actual, cyclical, and structural budget.      Cyclical unemployment.    See  fric-tional unemployment.       D     Deadweight loss.    The loss in real income or consumer and pro-ducer surplus that arises because of monopoly, tariffs and quotas, taxes, or other distortions. For example, when a monopolist raises its price, the loss in con-sumer satisfaction is more than the gain in the monopolist’s rev-enue—the difference being the deadweight loss to society due to monopoly.     $$&$$Debit.    @1@ An accounting term signifying an increase in assets or decrease in liabilities. @2@ In balance-of-payments accounting, a debit is an item such as imports that reduces a country’s stock of foreign currencies.

Also see  change in demand vs. change in quantity demanded.      $$&$$Demand for money.    A summary term used by economists to explain why individuals and businesses hold money balances. The major moti-vations for holding money are @1@  transactions demand,  signifying that people need money to pur-chase things, and @2@  asset demand,  relating to the desire to hold a very liquid, risk-free asset.     Demand-pull inflation.     a-tion caused by an excess demand for goods in general, caused, e.g., by a major increase in aggregate demand. Often contrasted with   ation.      $$&$$Demography.    The study of the behav-ior of a population.     $$&$$$$&$$Depreciation  @of an asset@.   A decline in the value of an asset. In both business and national accounts, depreciation is the dollar estimate of the extent to which capital has been “used up” or worn out over the period in question. Also termed  capital consumption allowance  in national-income accounting.     $$&$$$$&$$Depreciation  @of a currency@.   A nation’s currency is said to depre-ciate when it declines relative to other currencies. For example, if the foreign exchange rate of the dollar falls from 200 to 100 Japanese Yen per U.S. dollar, the dollar’s value has fallen, and the dollar has undergone a deprecia-tion. The opposite of a deprecia-tion is an  appreciation,  which occurs when the foreign exchange rate of a currency rises.     $$&$$Depression.    A prolonged period characterized by high unemploy-ment, low output and investment,  dence, falling prices, and widespread business failures. A milder form of business downturn is a  recession,  which has many of the features of a depression to a lesser extent.     $$&$$Derived demand.    The demand for a factor of production that results @is “derived”@ from the demand  nal good to which it con-tributes. Thus the demand for tires is derived from the demand for automobile transportation.     $$&$$Devaluation.     -cial price of a nation’s currency, usually expressed in the currency of another nations @such as the U.S. dollar@ or in terms of gold @in a gold standard@. The opposite of devaluation is  revaluation,  which  -cial foreign exchange rate relative to another currency.     $$&$$Developing country.    A country with a per capita income far below that of “developed” nations @the latter usu-ally includes most nations of North America and Western Europe@. Same as  less developed country.      Differentiated products.    Products which compete with each other and are close substitutes but are not identical. Differences may be manifest in the product’s func-tion, appearance, location, quality, or other attributes.     Diminishing marginal utility, law of.    The law which says that as more and more of any one com-modity is consumed, its marginal utility declines.     $$&$$Diminishing returns, law of.    A law stating that the additional out-put from successive increases of one input will eventually dimin-ish when other inputs are held constant. Technically, the law is equivalent to saying that the mar-ginal product of the varying input declines after a point.     Direct taxes.    Taxes levied directly  rms, including taxes on income, labor earnings,  ts. Direct taxes contrast with  indirect taxes,  which are levied on goods and services and thus only indirectly on people, such as sales taxes and taxes on property, alcohol, imports, and gasoline.     $$&$$Discount rate.    @1@ The interest rate charged by a Federal Reserve Bank @the central bank@ on a loan that it makes to a commercial bank. @2@ The rate used to calculate the present value of some asset.     $$&$$Discounting  @of future income@.   The process of converting future income into an equivalent pres-ent value. This process takes a future dollar amount and reduces  ects the appropriate interest rate. For example, if someone promises you $121 in 2 years, and the appropri-ate interest rate or discount rate is 10 percent per year, then we can calculate the present value by dis-counting the $121 by a discount factor of @1.10@ 2 . The rate at which future incomes are discounted is called the  discount rate.      $$&$$Discrimination.    Differences in earn-ings that arise because of personal characteristics that are unrelated to job performance, especially those related to gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion.     $$&$$Disequilibrium.    The state in which an economy is not in  equilibrium.  This may arise when shocks @to income or prices@ have shifted demand or supply schedules but the market price @or quantity@ has not yet adjusted fully. In mac-roeconomics, unemployment is often thought to stem from mar-ket disequilibria.     $$&$$Disinflation.    The process of reducing  ation rate. For example, the deep recession of 1980–1983  ation over that period.     Disposable income @  DI   @.    Roughly, take-home pay, or that part of the total national income that is avail-able to households for consump-tion or saving. More precisely, it is equal to GDP less all taxes, busi-ness saving, and depreciation plus government and other transfer payments and government inter-est payments.  sam11290_glo.indd   659sam11290_glo.indd   6592/24/09   2:58:31 PM2/24/09   2:58:31 PM660     $$&$$Economic efficiency.

The study of how soci-eties use scarce resources to pro-duce valuable commodities and distribute them among different people.     $$&$$$$&$$Economics.of information.    Analysis of economic situations that involve information as a commodity. Because information is costly to produce but cheap to reproduce, market failures are common in markets for informational goods and services such as invention, publishing, and software.     $$&$$Economies of scale.    Increases in pro-ductivity, or decreases in average cost of production, that arise from increasing all the factors of pro-duction in the same proportion.     $$&$$Effective tax rate.    Total taxes paid as a percentage of the total income or other tax base; also known as  average tax rate.      $$&$$Efficiency.

See  dominant strategy.      $$&$$Dominant strategy.    In game theory, a situation where one player has a best strategy no matter what strat-egy the other player follows. When all players have a dominant strat-egy, we say that the outcome is a  dominant equilibrium.      Downward-sloping demand, law of.    The rule which says that when the price of some commod-ity falls, consumers will purchase more of that good, other things held equal.     $$&$$Duopoly.

The branch of econom-ics that uses the methods of statistics to measure and estimate quantita-tive economic relationships.     $$&$$$$&$$Efficiency.wage theory.    According to this theory, higher wages lead to higher productivity. This occurs because with higher wages workers are healthier, have higher morale, and have lower turnover.     $$&$$Efficient financial market.     nan-cial market displaying the charac-teristics of an  ef cient market.      $$&$$Efficient market @ also  efficient-market theory@.    A market or theory in which all new information is quickly absorbed by market par-ticipants and becomes immedi-ately incorporated into market  cient-market theory holds that all cur-rently available information is already incorporated into the price of common stocks @or other assets@.     $$&$$Elasticity.    A term widely used in eco-nomics to denote the responsive-ness of one variable to changes in another. Thus the elasticity of  X  with respect to  Y  means the percentage change in  X  for every 1 percent change in  Y . For espe-cially important examples, see  price elasticity of demand  and  price elasticity of supply.      $$&$$Employed.     cial U.S.  nitions, persons are employed if they perform any paid work or if they hold jobs but are absent because of illness, strike, or vacations.     $$&$$Equal-cost line.

An excise tax is one levied on the purchase  c commodity or group of commodities @e.g., alcohol or tobacco@. A  sales tax  is one levied on all commodities with only a few  c exclusions @e.g., all pur-chases except food@.     $$&$$Exclusion principle.    A criterion by which public goods are distin-guished from private goods. When a producer sells a commodity to person A and can easily exclude B, C, D, etc., from enjoying the ben- ts of the commodity, the exclu-sion principle holds and the good is a private good. If, as in public health or national defense, people cannot easily be excluded from  ts of the good’s production, then the good has public-good characteristics.     Exogenous vs. induced variables.    Exogenous variables are those determined by conditions outside the economy. They are contrasted with  induced variables,  which are determined by the internal work-ings of the economic system. Changes in the weather are exog-enous; changes in consumption are often induced by changes in income.     $$&$$Expectations.

Equilib-rium unemployment arises when people are voluntarily unem-ployed rather than unemployed because of a failure of labor mar-kets to clear. An example is the frictional unemployed that occurs when people move voluntarily from job to job or in and out of the labor force.     $$&$$Equimarginal principle.    A principle for deciding the allocation of income among different consump-tion goods. Under this principle, a consumer’s utility is maximized by choosing the consumption information. $$&$$Expectations.are said to be  adaptive   if people form their expectations on the basis of past behavior.     $$&$$Expected rate of inflation.

External diseconomies.    Situations in which production or consump-tion imposes uncompensated costs on other parties. Steel fac-tories that emit smoke and sulfu-rous fumes harm local property and public health, yet the injured parties are not paid for the dam-age. The pollution is an external diseconomy.     External economies.    Situations in which production or consump- ts to others without those others pay- rm that hires a security guard scares thieves from the neighborhood, thus provid-ing external security services.

The ratio of the increase in the money sup-ply @or in deposits@ to the increase in bank reserves. Generally, the money-supply multiplier is equal to the inverse of the required reserve ratio. For example, if the required reserve ratio is 0.125, then the money-supply multiplier is 8.     $$&$$Monopolistic competition.

The mirror image of monopoly: a market in which there is a single buyer; a “buyer’s monopoly.”     Moral hazard.    A type of market failure in which the presence of insurance against an insured risk increases the likelihood that the risky event will occur. For example, a car owner insured 100 percent against auto theft may be careless about locking the car because the presence of insurance reduces the incentive to prevent the theft.     MPC .

Normative economics  considers “what ought to be”—value judgments, or goals, of public policy.  Positive eco-nomics,  by contrast, is the analysis of facts and behavior in an econ-omy, or “the way things are.”     $$&$$Not in the labor force.    That part of the adult population that is neither working nor looking for work.      O     $$&$$Okun’s Law.    The empirical relation-ship, discovered by Arthur Okun, between cyclical movements in GDP and unemployment.

A  closed economy  is one that has no imports or exports.     $$&$$Open-economy multiplier.    $$&$$Multiplier.analysis as applied to economies that have foreign trade. The open-economy multiplier is smaller than the closed-economy multi-plier because there is a leakage of spending into imports as well as into saving.     $$&$$Open-market operations.    The activ-ity of a central bank in buying or  u-ence bank reserves, the money supply, and interest rates. If secu-rities are bought, the money paid out by the central bank increases commercial-bank reserves, and the money supply increases. If securities are sold, the money sup-ply contracts.     $$&$$Opportunity cost.    The value of the best alternative use of an economic good. Thus, say that the best alter-native use of the inputs employed to mine a ton of coal was to grow 10 bushels of wheat. The oppor-tunity cost of a ton of coal is thus the 10 bushels of wheat that  could  have been produced but were not. $$&$$Opportunity cost.is particularly useful for valuing nonmarketed goods such as environmental health or safety.     Optimal currency area.    A group-ing of regions or countries which have high labor mobility or have common and synchronous aggre-gate supply or demand shocks.  cant changes in exchange rates are not necessary to ensure rapid macro-economic adjustment, and the  xed exchange rates or a common currency.     $$&$$Ordinal utility.    A dimensionless util-ity measure used in demand the-ory. $$&$$Ordinal utility.enables one to state that A is preferred to B, but we cannot say by how much. That is, any two bundles of goods can be ranked relative to each other, but the absolute difference between bundles cannot be measured. This contrasts with  cardinal utility,  or dimensional utility, which is some-times used in the analysis of behav-ior toward risk. An example of a cardinal measure comes when we say that a substance at 100 K @kel-vin@ is twice as hot as one at 50 K.  sam11290_glo.indd   669sam11290_glo.indd   6692/24/09   2:58:32 PM2/24/09   2:58:32 PM670     Other things constant.    A phrase @sometimes stated “ ceteris paribus ”@  es that a factor under consideration is changed while all other factors are held constant or unchanged.
